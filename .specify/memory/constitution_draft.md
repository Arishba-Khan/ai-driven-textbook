# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Clarity First
Crystal-clear explanations using simple English for complete beginners in robotics; All concepts must be accessible to students with Python and basic AI knowledge but no robotics experience

### Encouraging Tone
Maintain warm, mentor-like, supportive tone throughout like a helpful teacher who believes in the student; Use "You've got this — let's build it together!" voice

### Hands-on Mandate
EVERY major topic MUST include complete, copy-paste-ready code examples with clear comments and expected output shown

### Zero Fluff, Maximum Value
Every word must teach - no filler content; All content must directly contribute to learning outcomes

### Verbatim Content Requirements
All hardware tables and syllabus content MUST be reproduced VERBATIM from the syllabus - no changes allowed; Introduction sections must be included verbatim

### Complete Syllabus Coverage
100% syllabus coverage is mandatory - every bullet from syllabus appears as its own section; All modules (ROS 2, Gazebo & Unity, NVIDIA Isaac™, VLA) must be covered comprehensively

## Technical Standards
Chapter Structure: Overview → Core Concepts → Hands-on Examples → Key Takeaways → Quick Exercises; Terminology: First use is bolded and explained immediately in simple terms; Visuals: All diagrams in Mermaid, all tables in clean Markdown; Code Examples: Always testable with clear comments; Hardware Tables: Reproduced verbatim from syllabus

## Success Criteria
100% syllabus coverage - every bullet from syllabus appears as its own section; Every chapter follows the exact required structure; All hardware tables reproduced character-for-character; Minimum 12 complete, copy-paste-ready code examples; Site builds perfectly with zero errors; Mobile experience is flawless, dark mode perfect; A student with Python + basic AI knowledge can confidently start building humanoid robots after reading

## Governance
All PRs/reviews must verify constitution compliance; Content must follow required chapter structure; Code examples must be tested and functional; Syllabus coverage must be verified; Changes to hardware tables must match syllabus exactly
